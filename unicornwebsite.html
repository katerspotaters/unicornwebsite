    The team behind <a href="https://2018.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/icy-glare/recycle-polar-opposites/teams/unicode-unicorns-1/project">iceCycle,</a> the Unicode Unicorns, is composed of two data scientists: <a href="https://twitter.com/ursi9_ghost">Kelby Stockstill,</a> who made his hacking debut at Space Apps 2018, he plans to keep hacking in <a href="http://hackingmedicine.mit.edu/nyc-grandhack-2018/">MIT's Hacking Medicine</a> this month; and <a href="https://twitter.com/katers_potaters">Katelyn Hertel,</a> Space Apps veteran and winner of the 2016 Brooklyn competition for her team's submission of A Mesh Network of Self Propelling Origami Robots for the Surface of Mars. Project details <a href="https://spaceappsorigaminy.tumblr.com/">here.</a>

    Project iceCycle focuses on finding where machine learning can contribute to the field of Arctic climatology. Traditional weather models require complex equations with many input variables - requiring precision measurements. Stockstill and Hertel hope to use modern predictive statistics methodology to enable more robust sea ice predictions, flexible enough to predict sea ice oscillations in today's changing climate.

    Since the hack, team Unicode Unicorns has been in touch with several organizations seeking support. NASA's <a href="https://nsidc.org/">NSIDC<a/> and <a href="https://ncar.ucar.edu/">NCAR</a> professional have been very open to explaining their work and sharing thoughts on how machine learning might benefit predictions. <a href="http://meteomatics.com/display/WELCOME/Home">Meteomatics,</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/Meteomatics?lang=en">@Meteomatics,</a> a weather forecast service and data provider, took great interest in the project and now officially sponsors the Unicode Unicorns and project iceCycle.
